# The `/world` page

In addition to other sites being able to remotely view and respond to your content, you can also discover new content from NodeBB. This is established by "following" other users, similar to how you can follow users locally on NodeBB. [See "Content Discovery"](./discovery.md).

The main difference between following a local user and a remote user is that **you are not notified of new content from remote users**. Instead, that content is added to the `/world` page, which is your personal curated list of content from users you follow, and content from other users shared by followed users.

This page is structured like a regular category, with tools to filter down and sort topics. Incoming content is sorted into new or existing topics based on resolved context.
