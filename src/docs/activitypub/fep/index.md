# Fediverse Enhancement Proposals

While the ActivityPub protocol enables NodeBB to connect to the wider fediverse, there have been additional proposals that make the integration richer, both for developers and end-users alike.

There [are many proposals currently listed](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main), and not all of them apply to NodeBB or fit with our current roadmap. A list of relevant FEPs, their integration state (if any), and our general sentiment towards them are listed here.

This page is styled in a manner similar to [Mozilla's Specification Positions](https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/) page. We will use the same terms: "positive", "neutral", "defer", and "negative".
