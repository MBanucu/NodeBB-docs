# 7458: Using the replies collection

NodeBB has elected to partially follow FEP 7458 for maintenance of the `replies` collection.

## Our implementation

A `replies` route is available for every local post in NodeBB. This route resolves to an `OrderedCollection` containing a chronologically-ordered list of `Note` objects who have identified as being `inReplyTo` the requested post.

In NodeBB, they are considered "direct replies".

Please note that the replies route is always present even if there are no direct replies to the post.

## Partial Implementation

FEP 7458 lays out the foundational elements related to cross-checking an incoming object for presence in the `inReplyTo.replies` collection.

At this time NodeBB does not satisfy this requirement. All incoming objects are parsed, assuming they satisfy the internal check for an existing relation.
